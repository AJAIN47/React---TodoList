# React---TodoList
# Todo-App
This version of short ToDo App shows **Props Drilling.**
It is made to show how we have to pass several props to components and is not the correct way to do.
This could be avoided by using Redux as state manaement tool.
Props drilling basically just refers to when you have multiple components. Component A displays component B, displays component C. And component B is stuck passing props back and forth between those two components.
And this is something that happens very frequently as our React apps get more complex.
